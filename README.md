- What did you find? Which borough is the most expensive? Any other interesting trends?
  - We found out that initially we have 340 rows x 49 columns in our Dataset and after cleaning,deleting and transforming our data, it's converting into 16272 Rows x 4 columns.
  - After checking out the contents of the London Borough column we saw that we have 48 unique London Boroughs but when we searched we found out that there are only 32 London Boroughs in actuality .So as a solution we deleted Unnamed and Unknown values that are not a part of London Boroughs.
  - By analyzing our Dataset we can see that “Hackney” has seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades.
  
  

- Another interesting trend which we can see after investigating the Dataset that calculates mean house prices for each year we found out that the “Kensington & Chelsea” borough has seen continuous price increases each and every year and there is a big difference between this and the other Boroughs.




- How did you arrive at your conclusion?
  - By calculating the ratio of average prices for each borough between 1998 and 2018




- What were the main challenges you encountered? How did you overcome them? What could you not overcome?
  - The main challenge which I face not only in this project but in every project is to know the quality and integrity of data but we can overcome this by searching and checking out the quality checks on each step.


- Is there anything you’d like to investigate deeper?
  Yes, if I get a chance to investigate further on this topic I really need to know what specific dynamics contribute to one borough being more expensive than others in terms of housing prices.
  I will definitely consider some key factors that can influence the relative pricing of boroughs which are not limited to 

  - Location
  - Amenities and Facilities
  - Transportation Accessibility
  - Housing Stock and Property Types
  - School Districts
  - Local Economy and Job Opportunities
  - Demographics and Lifestyle
